# Building
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

In China, you may want to replace npm with cnpm for a faster download speed.

```bash
npm install cnpm -g --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
cnpm install
cnpm start
```

# Debugging
There's three ways to open the [Chromium Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

* Add `--debug` to the command line args:
```bash
npm start -- --debug
```

* Set `debug` to `true` in the config. The config file is stored in `~/.config/configstore/Moeditor.json` (for every system).

* `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` in Linux / Windows or `Command` + `Option` + `I` in OS X / macOS to toggle devtools for a window.

# Todo
* [ ] Custom themes
* [ ] Spell check
* [ ] UI/UX

# Localization
Moeditor will auto detect your system language and use the localization.

You can set language manually in the Settings window.

Now the app supports English, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and *incomplete* Portuguese.

**Help us** if you can translate this app. Please follow the guide in `app/moe-l10n.js`.
